# VDV 301 
## Internet protocol based communication services in public transport - IBIS-IP

This repository is used for further development of the XML files related to
*VDV Schrift 301 (IBIS-IP)* of the **Verband Deutscher Verkehrsunternehmen**.

### Workflow

The further development to the next official release is brought together in the
`master` branch of the `VDVde/VDV301` repository.

When an official release is made, the related commit is marked as a release with
a corresponding tag (e.g. `VDV-301-2.1`). 

If something still has to be done on released versions (which hopefully
never or rarely happens), a corresponding branch will be created in the
`VDVde/VDV301` repository (subsequently branched off at the corresponding release tag).

The actual work takes place in individual forks.
Pull requests into the `master` (or one of the above mentioned "correction"
branches) can be filed by anyone.

If **all** members of the *XSD File Pool Team* have given their approval (as comments in
the pull request), the pull request will be merged into the target branch
by one of the maintainers.
